Handlebars whitespace handling is a bit tricky (at least to me).  So here's some reverse-engineered behavior documentation
so I won't forget how this works.


Each non-Text tag ("{{...}}") is guaranteed, by the parser, to be surrounded by Whitespace tags (WS), which may have content, or be empty,
but they will always be there.  Even the close tags ("{{/...}}") are likewise sandwiched by Whitespace tags.

So let's take the following cases with descriptions of whitespace control (wsctl), or "~" decorations, which can be present on
either side of a tag:  {{~foo}}, {{foo~}}, {{~foo~}}

    1) Single (non-block) tag.  It has leading/trailing Whitespace tags surrounding it.

       Behavior for {{foo}} (no wsctl): print all surround WS.
       Behavior for {{~foo}}: ignore leading WS
       Behavior for {{foo~}}: ignore trailing WS
       Behavior for {{~foo~}}: ignore all WS

    2) Block tags have 4 whitespace areas to manage:

        (ws1){{tag}}(ws2) ...body... (ws3){{/tag}}(ws4)

            -- converted to --

        (ws1){{tag}}(ws4)  --> next top-level tag
          {{openProxy}}(ws2)
          ...body...
          (ws3){{closeProxy}}

       It appears that if a closing tag is all on the same line, its trailing whitepsace (ws4) is ignored **to the \n** (not the entire
       whitespace, which might wrap to the next line).  {{/tag~}} would delete all trailing whitespace, even beyond the \n.

       If tag on one line, trim ws1 and ws2 to closest proximate NL

       (If inserted leading TagProxy has ~ trailing ctl then internal render should've already handed it!)
       (If inserted trailing (close) TagProxy has ~ leading ctl then internal render should've alrady handled it!)

       If /tag is on one line then trim ws3 and ws4 to closest proximate NL


Partials:

1) inline
  Contextualize the template, NOT the block!

2) normal (registered--nonblock)
  Contextualize partial Template, NOT the block!  Use ws controls from {{> foo}} tag
  >> contextualize() can be baked in HelperTag!

3) block (registered--maybe there, maybe not)
4) block @partial-block
   a. assign @partial-block variable to block contents
   b. if partial exists, call it (may or may not consume @partial-block)
   c. if !exists, output @partial-block (block contents)

   If printing block contents, contextualize it!


{{(1)#* inline "nombre"(2)}}
A
  B -- {{name}}
C
{{(3)/inline(4)}}
My name is:
{{(5)>nombre(6)}}
  Say it loud!

It seems (2) ws is controlled by (2) || (5)

>>>> More spacing:  Iff #* tag is not clear before, render as-is, including any \n after the tag (after (2))
If #* tag is clear, then clip trailing ws to \n after the tag
